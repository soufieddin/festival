            synopsis:"Trucker hat, beard, tattoos… Rory Graham may look slightly terrifying, he’s actually a big friendly giant. And that certainly comes across in ‘Human’ (2016), a heartfelt song that became an instant classic. Graham's stage name is from Rags’n’Bonez, a drum’n’bass project that he started in his hometown of Brighton at the age of fifteen. He's mad about hip hop, but his greatest discovery in music is the blues. One day, dad Graham entered his boy for a jam session in a local pub. Rory performed a song by blues legend Robert Johnson, and from that moment on, he was well and truly hooked. His first album ‘Human’ (2017) became the fastest selling debut album in years. His latest single ‘Giant’ (2019), a duet with Calvin Harris, was nominated in the Song of the Year category at the Brit Awards.",

Drummer Ben Thatcher picked him up at the airport, and on the way home they decided to start a band. They played their first gig the very next day. Royal Blood produce a delicious kind of noise that has been compared to Queens of The Stone Age and The White Stripes. They were catapulted into the limelight when Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders wore one of the band’s t-shirts on stage at Glastonbury 2013. Next, they were selected for BBC Sound Of 2014, the annual list of promising artists drawn up by members of the UK music press. A review of their previous Werchter appearance in 2017 said, ‘Royal Blood played the main stage to smithereens’. This is the pair’s fifth time.",

Nate Hiltes and Danny Kenyon, however, soon tired of all that noise. They convinced two friends to learn to play mandolin and banjo. The four of them turned to bluegrass, the folk music of immigrants in the south-eastern United States. The Dead South inject the genre with humour. On one hand they are in love with the music, while on the other they like to laugh about it. The result sounds like the drunken cousins of Mumford & Sons. These modern hillbillies have developed into a popular party band, with their own dance moves. However, there is a darker edge to them. The merriment disguises their stories of despair and deceit. They are beautiful stories, though.",

Some of the headlines: ‘So much grandeur’. ‘An infectious carnival’. ‘Dancing towards a better world’. Shortly afterwards, Albarn announced that we shouldn’t expect too much over the next ten years. Then in January this year, they presented the musical concept ‘Song Machine’. And next year, the first virtual band in history is heading back out on tour. From now on, Gorillaz will release music in episodes, whenever new material is ready. Each episode features a different guest:  in 2020 the likes of slowthai, Fatoumata Diaware, Peter Hook (New Order), Georgia and Octavian joined forces with the band.",

He is the visionary beatmaker who developed the blueprint for the melancholy indie pop of The xx. He is also a DJ with exceptional taste and an impressive musical knowledge. His sets are a parade of forgotten gems. ‘In Colour’ (2015), his first solo album, is the sum total of the two Jamies. It was a party album for the brain and the feet; for both the campfire and the dancefloor. It was a brilliant success, bagging nominations for the Brit Awards, Grammy Awards and many others. After that, he once again gave his undivided attention to The xx. However, the itch persisted, and this spring, the single ‘Idontknow’ gave us a glimpse of a sharper, more aggressive Jamie xx to come.",

This alternative rock band from the English coastal town of Southend plays passionate guitar rock with pop sensibilities. They have a secret weapon in vocalist Conor Mason. This man’s voice has a range to rival Adele.  The quintet has earned acclaim from the very start. Their eponymous album stormed the UK charts in 2015 and sold over 250,000 copies. Since ‘Broken Machine’ (2017), recorded with the eminent Mike Crossey (Twenty One Pilots, The 1975, Foals), the rest of Europe has cottoned on. ‘Moral Panic’ will be released in October.",

You’d think this would inevitably weigh on the mood of its inhabitants, but it seems to have had the opposite effect on Nicolas Pablo Muñoz. The young singer-songwriter with Chilean roots has the natural cheerfulness of Mac DeMarco, Ween or - to go a long way back in time - Jonathan Richman. Although he mostly writes and records his sunny indie pop alone, Pablo loves to perform live with four old school friends. His music found its way into the world with ‘Everytime’ (2017). The accompanying video has been watched more than 30 million times. In Norway, boy pablo is already a national hero, and the rest of the world is bound to follow with his debut album ‘Wachito Rico’ (2020).",

He possesses an androgynous, honeyed voice that attracts the human ear immediately. The self-titled debut of Cigarettes After Sex contained some of the most sweetly delicious sounds of 2017. Each song is a warm blanket draped gently around your shoulders. It all sounds so sophisticated, too, which is strange considering the whole album was recorded in a cheap demo studio in three days. The latest, ‘Cry’ (2019), is the result of an intense week’s work on Majorca.",
